# !! THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS !!

## What is this?
The plan is for this to eventually become a fully fledged BeatSaber map editor which is capable of editing both vanilla maps *and* modded maps well. Initially it will only be a map viewer, then a vanilla map editor, and finally a modded map editor. Once that is complete I will begin adding small quality of life features and tools to speed up the mapping process for both modded and vanilla maps.

## Features
- Playing a difficulty from an unzipped map
- Audio syncing
- Play/Pause
- Seeking

## What mods are planned to be supported?
- Noodle Extensions
- Chroma

## How do I use this?
There is currently no official release for this program, it doesn't even have a name yet. However, if you want to use it, you will need to install Unity 2019.4.29f1 and either compile it yourself or run it directly in Unity. Once this becomes more polished and more usable, precompiled binaries will be made available for Windows and Linux, but for now this is your only option.

## Suggestions/Issues
If you have any suggestions or issues with this, please create an issue on github and explain what you would like to see added or fixed, and I will see if I can do it.
